         <div class = "description">Met virtually in the summer of 2015 when Clara stayed the night with two of her best friends in Maryland. Cora knew Garrett, then living in Wyoming, from their childhood, and gave him a call on facetime. That night, Clara and Garrett became friends on Snapchat and began to talk almost every day.</div>

         <div class = "description">After talking virtually for a year and becoming great friends, Garrett flew out to Maryland to finally meet Clara in person. He stayed at Cora's house for a day and a half. During that time, Clara and Garrett realized that their friendship meant a lot more to them than they originally thought. They were afraid because admitting that they loved each other meant that they would have to be long-distance. And, being in high school, they didn't know when they would be able to see each other next.</div>

         </div>
         <div class = "description">Following their first meeting, they decided that they wanted to make it work, began to develop their relationship long distance, and hoped for a chance to see each other again soon. Finally, in the Winter of 2017, Clara's parents graciously allowed Garrett to come spend the winter holidays with the Blitz family! The pair spent their first days together as a couple and it invigorated their hope for the relationship. Sadly, it was the first of many difficult goodbyes.</div>

         </div>
         <div class = "description">The couple continued to find time to visit one another and grew their love from afar in the meantime. Around this time, they only saw each other once or twice a year. In 2018 Clara went to visit Garrett out in Wyoming for the first time. This began their love for adventuring and road-tripping together. Everything seemed so much more wondrous when they were together, yet still there was always a goodbye waiting at the end of the trip.</div>

         <div class = "description">In the summer of 2019, Garrett got an internship at the NASA Godard center, placing him, for the first time, within an hour drive of Clara. They spent the most time together than they ever had before and continued to appreciate every moment of it. This summer, they celebrated their 3rd year anniversary. The time between visiting each other was shrinking.</div>

         </div>
         <div class = "description">In this year, Garrett and Clara saw each other even more often. They went on their first road trip together in the Midwest. They spent part of the school year together in quarantine during the pandemic. And they continued to visit each other several more times after that. This year and the following year would prove to be the most difficult for the pair in their personal lives, yet their relationship remained strong and a point of comfort.</div>

         <div class = "description">In the Fall of 2021, Garrett moved from Wyoming to Cincinnati, OH. While still long-distance, the couple was now driving distance away and began to visit each other almost every month. The light at the end of the tunnel could be seen.</div>

         <div class = "description">On Christmas Day of 2022, Garrett gifted Clara a handmade booklet in her stocking. It was a promise to go on a day full of dates on the 27th of December.
           He promised a breakfast date, ice skating, a lunch date, going to the art museum, a drink together, a walk in the park, and a fancy dinner date.
           Clara felt spoiled by the thoughtfulness and generosity of the gift, while Garrett knew that there was an extra surprise event to look forward to.</div>

         </div>
         <div class = "description">Garrett and Clara enjoyed every moment of their date day together. They took no moment for granted as time together had been more sparse since they both began their jobs. (Yet never as sparse as it had been).
           The weather was overcast but it had recently snowed in Cincinnati, coating everything in a hazy white blanket that contrasted with the city landscape.
           As they looked out at the Ohio river at an overlook in Eden Park, Garrett began to express how lucky he felt to have spent the last 6.5 years with Clara.
           He turned her towards himself, got down on one knee, and proposed that they spend the rest of their lives together.
           With tears in her eyes and a huge smile, Clara said yes.</div>
